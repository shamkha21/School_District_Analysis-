# School_District_Analysis- 
## Findings  
#### One of the few findings we discovered while our analysis was that the average budget per grade increased as the grade number increased. I also found that there was a big difference between the highest reading score and the lowest reading score. Additional analysis that could have been useful would have been seeing the budget difference difference between reading score and math score. Intuitively, one would assume the scores would be higher if the budget is higher, but it would be nice to have data to prove that.
